# pre_install_actions - list of actions to run before installing the addon.
# Examples would be removing an extraneous docker volume,
# or doing a sanity check for requirements.
# DDEV environment variables can be interpolated into these actions
# pre_install_actions are executed in the context of the target project's root directory.
pre_install_actions:

# list of files and directories listed that are copied into project .ddev directory
# Each file should contain #ddev-generated so it can be replaced by a later `ddev add-on get`
# if it hasn't been modified by the user.
# DDEV environment variables can be interpolated into these filenames
# If you use directories, they must be directories that are managed
# by this add-on, or removal could remove things that are not owned by it
project_files:
  - docker-compose.mindsdb.yaml

# List of files and directories that are copied into the global .ddev directory
# DDEV environment variables can be interpolated into these filenames
# Note that if these files are used by a team, you will need to automate their installation
# by adding `ddev add-on get` to your workflow to ensure that everyone has them.
# Otherwise, use 'project_files' to commit them to the repository.
global_files:

# Version constraint for DDEV that will be validated against the running DDEV executable
# and prevent add-on from being installed if it doesn't validate.
# See https://github.com/Masterminds/semver#checking-version-constraints for constraint rules.
# Available with DDEV v1.23.4+, and works only for DDEV v1.23.4+ binaries
# example: ddev_version_constraint: '>= v1.23.4'
ddev_version_constraint: ''

# List of add-on names that this add-on depends on
dependencies:

# DDEV environment variables can be interpolated into these actions.
# post_install_actions are executed in the context of the target project's .ddev directory.
post_install_actions:

# Shell actions that can be done during removal of the add-on.
# Files listed in project_files section will be automatically removed here if they contain #ddev-generated line.
# removal_actions are executed in the context of the target project's .ddev directory.
removal_actions:

# Advanced usage - YAML files can be read in and then used as go template actions
# in pre_install_actions and post_install_actions
# See example in
# https://github.com/ddev/ddev/blob/master/cmd/ddev/cmd/testdata/TestCmdAddonComplex/recipe/install.yaml
